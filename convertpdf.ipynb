Randomisation codes were computer‑| generated, and allotment concealed in opaque numbered envelopes. The intervention effect was assessed with linear | mixed models.| Main outcome: Change in HbA1c after 3‑month follow‑up.| Primary analysis involved all participants.| Clinicaltrial.gov identifier:NCT04780425, retrospectively registered on 03/03/2021.|\n",

      "<p>Diabetes is a long-standing epidemic with over half a | billion adults affected globally. [ 1 ] In Ghana, the overall | prevalence of diabetes among the general adult popula-| tion is 7% [ 2 ]. Diabetes is a leading cause of mortality in | Accra, the capital of Ghana.

      "<p>PLD in sub-Saharan Africa. Unfortunately, in resource-| constrained settings translating self-management skills | into practice can be challenging.| There are multiple and complex barriers to self-man-| agement in low-resource settings. These barriers include | irregular diabetes supplies, financial constraints, low | health literacy and culture [ 19 ]. In the African context, | culture is a significant barrier to adhering to self-manage-| ment recommendations [ 20 ,  21 ]. Complex cultural belief | systems are particularly challenging for Ghanaians living | with diabetes [ 10 ,  22 ].| The DSME intervention we tested was culturally tai-| lored for the Ghanaian population, and linguistically | suited to low-literacy levels. This may potentially explain | the clinically relevant and significant reduction in HbA1c | within the intervention group. HbA1c is dependent on | self-management routines. The changes in the summary | of diabetes self-care activities scores suggest an improve-| ment in self-management routines within the interven-| tion group.| Our findings align with findings from most previous | studies [ 7 ,  23 ,  24 ]. In a recent systematic review of ran-| domised controlled trials investigating structured DSME | in PLD in Africa, seven out of the nine studies found no | association between structured DSME and HbA1c. Fur-| thermore, sub-group analysis revealed that, characteris-| tics of structured DSME interventions such as cultural | tailoring, duration, and intensity were not associated | with HbA1c.| The studies included in this systematic review share | some characteristics with our study and this may contrib-| ute to the congruence in the findings [ 7 ]. In the studies | included in the review, the structured DSME interven-| tions tested were culturally tailored, delivered mostly by | nurses and the comparator was usual clinical care. The | minimum mean baseline HbA1c was over 8%.[ 7 ]| The baseline mean HbA1c was over 10% in Hailu et al.’s | study among participants in Ethiopia. Additionally, 50% | of their study population had lived with diabetes for over | 10 years and participants received six sessions of DSME | over a 9-month period [ 24 ]. Compared to participants in | our study, participants in Hailu et al.’s study had relatively | higher baseline HbA1c values and longer study duration. | Yet, the findings from both studies are congruent. The | study by Gathu et al. in Kenya is another study included | in the systematic review [ 7 ]. It was conducted in a single | private facility among participants with low deprivation. | Our study was conducted in two public facilities among | participants with high deprivation. Again, despite the dif-| ferences, the findings from the two studies are congruent.| In summary, despite the case-mix variation between | studies there is homogeneity in the estimates of the |\n",
      "<p>association between structured DSME and glycaemic | control in PLD in Africa [ 7 ,  23 ,  24 ].| Our findings of a null association between structured | DSME and glycaemic control are inconsistent with stud-| ies from Kuwait, Nigeria, and our recently published | systematic review of structured DSME in low- middle-| income countries[ 8 ,  25 ,  26 ]. Our study population shares | similar characteristics with the study by Alibrahim et al. | undertaken in a primary care setting in Kuwait. Alibra-| him et  al. observed that, single 1-h small group DSME | sessions were associated with 1.7% reduction in HbA1c | at 12  months [ 25 ]. Consistent with these findings from | Kuwait, Essien et  al. also reported a 1.8% reduction in | HbA1c at six months among participants in Nigeria liv-| ing with type 1 or type 2 diabetes [ 26 ].| Our findings on HbA1c are consistent with those of | Davies et al. in a study undertaken in the UK[ 6 ], but dif-| fer from the findings from Mozambique and Malawi[ 11 ], | albeit in all three studies, the intervention tested was | underpinned by the same psychological theories of learn-| ing. Our study, and the study conducted by Davies et al. | were randomised control trials; this design maximises | internal validity and permits causal inferences. Brady | et al.[ 11 ], performed a feasibility study (with no control | group) on a purposively selected sample of 50 people, | thus limiting the ability to assess the relationship between | structured DSME and HbA1c. Davies et al. included only | participants who were newly diagnosed with diabetes | and used a cluster randomised design. This design may | limit contamination between the study groups.| In resource constrained-settings intervention contact | time can limit sustainability and scalability of a struc-| tured education program. It is not clear what the rela-| tion between intervention contact time and reduction in | HbA1c is. DSME Interventions with contact time greater | or equal to 10 h, have been shown to be associated with | significant reductions in HbA1c in a systematic review of | over 100 varieties of DSME programs [ 27 ]. However, in a | systematic review focusing on studies in African Ameri-| can populations, no association between HbA1c and | intervention contact, and provider time was observed | [ 28 ]. In our study the total contact time was desir-| ably short although the primary outcome did not reach | significance.| For most participants in our study, health literacy was | low, and the monthly cost of care was greater than half | of their monthly income. The average cost of manag-| ing one person with diabetes in a clinic in Accra in 2009 | was about US$ 28 monthly [ 29 ]. There is a positive linear | association between health literacy and socio-economic | variables [ 29 ]. The low income levels, combined with low | literacy, possibly denote high deprivation and this could |\n",

      "<p>have biased the association between HbA1c and struc-| tured DSME.| Our inability to standardise usual care between groups | is also a potential source of bias. Due to the nature of the | intervention, it was not possible to blind assessors, and | this might be responsible for ascertainment bias. How-| ever, the primary outcome, change in HbA1c was an | objective outcome thus limiting the risk of bias. Higher | baseline HbA1c values in the intervention group, may | indicate that those in the intervention group had more | advanced disease. This difference could also have biased | our estimate. Reassuringly these differences were not sta-| tistically significant; pointing to a robust randomization. | Stratification on baseline HbA1c would have resulted | in more balanced groups. At the time of randomisation | however,, baseline HbA1c values were not known.| The randomised controlled trial design, and the use | of a culturally adapted intervention are strengths of this | study. This design increases the internal validity of the | estimate of the effect of structured education on glycae-| mic control in the population.| The study was set in Ghana, in two public health facili-| ties, where the national health insurance scheme is the | main means of healthcare financing. Our findings may | therefore not be generalisable to community-based inter-| ventions or private facilities. We excluded participants | who were not ambulant, could not participate in group | activities and who were not primarily responsible for | their care, thus further limiting the generalisability of our | findings.|\n",

      "<h5>Conclusion|\n",
      "<p>Glycaemic control was not associated with DSME in this | study, although the reduction in HbA1c was larger in | the intervention group compared to usual care. Ideally, | DSME equips individuals with skills for decision making | and taking action. \n",
      "<s8>30\n",
      "<p> Deprivation as commonly pertains | in resource-constrained settings in SSA limits options | and thus, the possibility of taking action.| We thus recommend larger cluster randomised stud-| ies, with longer duration of follow-up, which focus on | enumerating the effect of structured DSME on glycaemic | control, in resource-constrained settings.|\n",
